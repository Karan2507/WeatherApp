# WeatherApp
With the help of weather API I generated a key with free license. *Key can be different for all*
You can generate the key by logging in on the weatherAPI.com *No need to pay for it. Use free version*
Used that key in the url to fetch the precise weather of  the respective location. 
And also, with the help of python voice assistance, displayed the result using json.loads method by creating a dictionary of specific parameters.
